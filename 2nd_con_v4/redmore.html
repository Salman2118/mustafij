                        <p>Manarat International University (MIU) was established in 2001 with a vision of ensuring international standards in higher education and to produce a future generation with high morals.

We have highly competent faculty with excellent academic credentials. Some of them have degrees from the United Kingdom, North America, China, Turkey, Malaysia, and other Asian top universities. At present, MIU has three schools offering seven undergraduate and two master’s programs.

                        <p>University Grants Commission of Bangladesh</p>
                        <p>I am very happy to know that Manarat International University is going to hold its 2nd convocation on 30 July 2023. Quality of education at the tertiary level remains a question of big concern for decades. Quality education in higher educational institutional institutions is key to the socio-economic progress of a nation. Apart from some renowned public universities, the endeavors of some private universities to improve the quality of higher education and develop world-class human resources are appreciable. It is, needed, to encourage that Daffodil International University has been trying to contribute positively to improving the quality of higher education in our country with special emphasis on ICT.

                            My heartiest congratulations to all graduating students and their parents, faculty members, and the management of the university.

                            I wish the Convocation a success.</p>
